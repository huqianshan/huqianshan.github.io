  abstract  = {Tree index structures are widely employed in modern storage systems to support high-performance queries. Persistent memory (PM) brings a new opportunity and challenge for tree indexes. Among persistent tree indexes, we find the radix tree is more suitable than B-Tree for the byte-ability of PM. However, the hierarchy of radix remains excessively high, resulting in high read latency. Node splitting imposes a significant overhead on PM. To address these challenges, we propose RWORT, a read and write optimized radix tree for PM. The key focus of RWORT is to minimize random access in PM and provide efficient write operations. RWORT proposed a hierarchical compression mechanism to significantly reduce the tree height. Additionally, RWORT incorporates mini bloom filters to reduce unnecessary access on PM. For efficient write operations, RWORT uses the lazy split flag and the double-linked pointers to reduce the critical path delay. Furthermore, RWORT introduces a low-overhead ring-based bit tree allocator that improves allocation efficiency on PM. Our experiments show that RWORT improves up to 1.62x/4.91x respectively compared to the state-of-the-art radix tree/B-Tree. RWORT also exhibits higher performance in real-world storage systems such as Memcached.},
