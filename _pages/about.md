I received the B.E. degree from the [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), Chengdu, in 2020. 
From 2020 to 2023, I was enrolled in the integrated Master-Ph.D. program at [HUST](https://hust.edu.cn), Wuhan, where I completed the requirements for the M.S. degree. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at HUST under the supervision of Prof. [Jianxi Chen](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/chenjianxi/zh_CN/index/1489977/list/index.htm) and Prof. [Dan Feng](https://hustdfeng.github.io/). 
My research is primarily focused on high-performance index structures for persistent memory and SSDs.
